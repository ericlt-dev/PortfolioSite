            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>I grew up in a small town outside of Jackson, Mississippi. I’ve spent most of my adulthood in New York City where I attended Pace University for Undergrad. I studied English and Information Technology during undergrad. I used the skills I gained to pursue a helpdesk position in the tech field. I quickly realized I needed something more fulfilling. I recently relocated to Washington D.C. to pursue other opportunities and my personal growth.</h2>

        <div class="card4 reveal" id="career">
            <h1>Career</h1>
            <h2>I’ve held three roles in the past that have been in the tech support field. Each role has had unique responsibilities but have also allowed me to gain immense experience with learning how people use technology. Technology is such an important aspect of society today and there are so many individuals who are not keen to the possibilities tech advancements could unlock. I believe one of the most fulfilling things is developing tech that is easier to navigate while still allowing great functionality. I would like to pivot from my support role into front-end development that allows me to manipulate the UI/UX of a website and mobile apps. Thus making tech more intuitive and appealing to interact with for everyone. </h2>

        <div class="card5 reveal" id="projects">

            <h2>As I work to build my portfolio of work and expand my skillset, I will place links here for all of the projects I’ve worked on so far. I look forward to my new path in front-end development. </h2>
